WAR - name of a clan...we come up with that later during story brainstorming phase
  - Chief = God
  - Each GOd has connection through stars with other gods
  - In death, person changes to energy, which is helps chiefs achieve their goals
  - Believers are brutal and bloodthirsty and they will do anything that helps their chief
PIECE - Harmonia(or Harmony....I like Harmonia better tho and it is understandable to english speaking people)
  - Goddess of Nature and everything alive....she isn really a goddess, more like an energy, but they treat her like one
  - Energy flows through every living thing
  - Nature is the most important thing for them
  - each year they celebrate midsummers night in their sacred temples all across the world
  - these temples cant be disturbed - only believers can enter them to give praise to Harmonia
  - People do not believe in afterlife, but once they die, they become one with the nature
  - Dead are not burried nor burned, instead they are left to Harmonia
LIFE - the Flame of Life
  - Similiar to Christianity in many ways
  - Each person has flame of life, and it is considered to be holy
  - God is the giver and the taker of life
  - Humanity has its own flame and every person lights it
  - Humanity must be pure for the fire to be undisturbed
  - Disturbance means flame going down, which means the Apocalypse - End of the World
  - science and progress are considered to be unholy because they make humanity less pure
  - Most common religion, but the weakest one mainly because their pursuit of pureness
  - They believe in reincarnation
Death - Magretum (Magna-Big Secretum-Secret....I know, very original....if you have better idea, please write it down)
  - Death is unknown and we shouldnt be afraid of it
  - sacrifice rituals are common and wildly celebrated
  - people are willingly sacrificing themselves
  - afterlife exists, but it is unknown
  - No God, but death itself
  - War is celebrated, but peace is accepted, mainly because death happens in every time and is part of nature
  - Highly uncommon, because it is considered to be a cult
